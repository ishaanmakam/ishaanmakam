## Hi there üëã

# Cisco Lab Portfolio

This is my full lab collection from my time in the Cisco Networking Academy. It includes all the CCNP labs and a few extra Cybersecurity labs I did. Some were done individually, others with a partner, but I made sure to understand every step before moving on. Everything here was built to actually work, not just to check a box.

I set this up mainly for myself‚Äîto keep it all in one place and track how far I‚Äôve come‚Äîbut I figured it‚Äôs worth posting since it shows the depth of config work we did.

Feel free to reach out if you‚Äôve got questions, or just want to talk networking.
