# Cisco Lab Portfolio

Hi, my name is Ishaan.

This is my full lab collection from my time in the Cisco Networking Academy. It includes all the Cybersecurity labs I completed on real Fortinet gear. Some were done with a partner, others solo, but I made sure everything worked and I understood the config before moving on. I built this repo to keep it all in one place and track progress.

Feel free to reach out if youâ€™ve got questions or want to talk networking.
